Wanna know what are the main issues android users experience in mobile Steam app? I have done investigation finding it.
Using natural language processing and machine learning models I found that about half of the negative reviews can be summarized in three issues:
  It was difficult to create account: invalid email, infinite buffering time, restarts if minimize the app
  It was difficult to log in the app: wrong password, steam guard not sending code, lost phone = no access
  It was difficult to reset the password: invalid email, no email verificaiton

For curious minds I have prepared a report describing the whole analysis (Steam_analysis.pdf)
For more curious ones there is the code for all operations and visuals (Steam_analysis.ipynb)
