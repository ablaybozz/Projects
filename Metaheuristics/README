This is the project for optimization of so-called Hub Location Problem.
If you are not familiar with this type of problem, please open the file, there is a detailed introduction to it.

For those who are familiar with the concept of problem and metaheuristics,
I have used Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search in combination with Tabu Search to approximate the best solution of Uncapacitated Single Allocation p-Hub Location Problem.

Result: less than 5% error from true optimal solution cost for 130 nodes dataset with 10 hubs in less than 20mins.
