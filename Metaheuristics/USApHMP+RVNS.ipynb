    "## The aim of the project\n",
    "...can be described on the example of airports. Imagine you have 10 cities, and for each pair of city, say A and B, there are ceratin number of people flying from A to B and another number of people flying from B to A. In total there would be 10 x 9 = 90 (quick math) possible routes and all are in demand. It would be a mess in the air, and this is only for 10 cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue can be resolved by promoting some of the cities to hubs. Flights between any two hubs are possible, but non-hub cities only have flights to hub(s) whcih they are allocated to. FYI, this actually happening in real world, that is why we cannot directly travel from Kazakhstan to USA, but have to stop somewhere in Europe, most probably in Frankfurt. If it is still not clear, here is a picture for help:"

    "On the figure there are 15 cities, 3 of them are hubs. All hubs are interconnected, while rest of cities are only connected to a ceratin hub. Other important point to mention is when a person is travelling between hubs it costs less than if the person would travel between same cities being not hubs. The explanation for this is the hubs are specially constructed and functioning for large flow of flights. Thus, their operation is optimized for large scales and they are operating more cost-efficiently. This is called the economy of scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, it is now more or less clear with airports. Let`s now shift to a general formulation and the task itself. In general problem cities are called nodes, hubs are hubs, when a node connected to a hubs it is called allocation to a hub, when a city promoted to a hub it is called location of hub, people travelling between cities are units. And economy of scale is taken into account as discount factor, a multiplier of cost of travel between hubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost there. There are plenty variants of hub location problem, but we are going to deal with the classic one, uncapacitated signle allocation p-hub location problem. Don`t be scared, it is just a name, the problem itself can be described by the following additional conditions:\n",
    "* The number of hubs is fixed and predetermined\n",
    "* Each non-hub node is allocated to only one hub\n",
    "* There is no capacity limit for any hub (unlimited flow of flights through a hub s permitted)\n",
    "* There is no fixed cost for hub location\n",
    "\n",
    "So, all in all, we are given the demand of units to travel between each pair of nodes, the unit cost of any potential (even not used) flights between two nodes, the number of hubs and the discount factor. And with this we need to find the location of hubs and allocation of non-hub nodes to those hubs that minimizes the total cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is NP-hard problem I have used metaheuristic approach to approximate the best solution. It would take too much time to explain the model, much more than a few paragraphs above. But if you are interested I have utilized Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search in combination with Tabu Search. The code with a small example is provided below.\n"
